# Raytracing in C++

## Project Structure

### on a weekend series

`src/wk1, wk2, wk3...`

these are implementation of the examples in Peter Shirley's raytracing on a weekend series, modified
for experimentation (FP and parallelism) and learning.

the accompanying tests are in `tests/wk1, wk2, wk3...`

see [README.md](src/wk1/README.md)

### benchmark

some short benchmark tests to compare the performance of different implementations for the
primitives (vectors, matrices and rays)

### 3rd party

third party libraries, see [README.md](3rdParty/README.md)
